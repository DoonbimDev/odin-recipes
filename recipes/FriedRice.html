    <h2><em>A delicious and filling meal that is super easy to make !</em></h2>  <!--title and description of the recipe-->
    <p>Fried rice has been a kitchen staple since as early as the Sui Dynasty (589-618 CE) in China.
       The primary reason for the continued popularity and ubiquity of this dish comes down to two things:
        its adaptability and the fact that people almost always cook too much rice to eat in one sitting. 
    </p>
        <p>Fried rice is a quick and delicious way to transform leftovers into something greater than the sum of its parts.
             Though we sometimes think of certain ingredients being typical (eggs, garlic) the only things you need to make fried rice are heat, rice, and oil.
             Anything else you add is up to you. Before you start cooking a batch though, read our tips below first!
