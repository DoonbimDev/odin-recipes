    <h2><em>A Mediterranean delight prefect for movie nights</em></h2>
    <p>If you've done some traveling around the Mediterranean and Southern Europe,
         you likely encountered some form of fried calamari in small fish shops or taverns.<br>
         The squid is coated in batter and quickly deep fried to golden perfection,
          then served hot with a splash of citrus and any number of dips.
    <p>
        <p>This is also a familiar dish throughout the United states, rising in popularity in the 1980s and becoming a mainstream appetizer served in most American casual dining restaurants. But you don't have to
             wait for your next outing with friends to share a plate of perfectly crispy fried calamari; it's easy to make at home.
        </p>
        <h3><strong>Ingridients</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><em>1 cup whole milk or buttermilk</em></li>
            <li><em>Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)</em></li>
            <li><em>1 pound squid tubes and tentacles, cleaned, rinsed and patted very dry</em></li>
            <li><em>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</em></li>
            <li><em>⅓ cup cornstarch</em></li>
            <li><em>2 tablespoons baking powder</em></li>
            <li><em>2 teaspoons paprika or black pepper (optional)</em></li>
            <li><em>Neutral oil, such as canola or vegetable, for shallow frying</em></li>
            <li><em>Lemon wedges and/or warmed</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong>Directions</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>
                In a medium bowl, stir together the milk and 2 teaspoons salt.
                 Cut the squid tubes 3/4-inch thick, then add to the milk mixture along with the tentacles.
                  Let sit for 5 minutes or up to 1 hour.
                 (Refrigerate if soaking for more than 15 minutes.)
            </li></strong>
            <br>
            <li><strong>
                In a large bowl, stir together the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and paprika or black pepper (if using).
                 Use your hands to shake excess milk from the squid, then transfer to the flour mixture.
                 Toss until well coated; you may need to open up the tubes to ensure their insides are coated in flour.
            </li></strong>
            <br>
            <li><strong>
                In a large (12-inch) cast-iron skillet or Dutch oven over medium, heat ½ inch of oil to 375 degrees.
                 Line a plate or sheet pan with paper towels. Add a handful of the squid to the oil and cook until golden brown, 1 to 3 minutes.
                  Stir only after the coating seems to have set. 
                (Any sooner and the coating could fall off.) Use a slotted spoon or tongs to transfer to the lined plate. Season with salt.
            </li></strong>
            <br>
            <li><strong>
                Return the oil to 375 degrees, fish out any browned bits,
                 and repeat with the rest of the squid in batches. 
                Eat with a squeeze of lemon and/or dunked in marinara sauce.
            </li></strong>
        </ol>
