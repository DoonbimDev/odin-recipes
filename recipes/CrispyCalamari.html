    <h2><em>A Mediterranean delight prefect for movie nights</em></h2>
    <p>If you've done some traveling around the Mediterranean and Southern Europe,
         you likely encountered some form of fried calamari in small fish shops or taverns.<br>
         The squid is coated in batter and quickly deep fried to golden perfection,
          then served hot with a splash of citrus and any number of dips.
