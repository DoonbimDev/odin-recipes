    <h2><em>A Mediterranean delight prefect for movie nights</em></h2>
    <p>If you've done some traveling around the Mediterranean and Southern Europe,
         you likely encountered some form of fried calamari in small fish shops or taverns.<br>
         The squid is coated in batter and quickly deep fried to golden perfection,
          then served hot with a splash of citrus and any number of dips.
    <p>
        <p>This is also a familiar dish throughout the United states, rising in popularity in the 1980s and becoming a mainstream appetizer served in most American casual dining restaurants. But you don't have to
             wait for your next outing with friends to share a plate of perfectly crispy fried calamari; it's easy to make at home.
